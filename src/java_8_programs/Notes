Source: Where the stream comes from.

Intermediate Operations: Transforms the stream into another one.
 There can be as few or as many intermediate operations as you’d like. 
 Since streams use lazy evaluation, the intermediate operations do not run until the terminal operation runs.



Terminal Operations: 
Actually produces a result. Since streams can be used only once, the stream is no longer valid after a terminal operation completes.
Pipeline of operations may contain any number of intermediate operations, but there has to be only one terminal operation, 
that too at the end of pipeline. Moreover, Intermediate operations are lazily loaded. When you call intermediate operations, they are actually not executed. They are just stored in the memory and executed when the terminal operation is called on the stream.
